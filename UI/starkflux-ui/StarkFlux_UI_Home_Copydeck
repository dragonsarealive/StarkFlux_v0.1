How It Works
Step 1 — Upload Components
Upload smart contracts, SDKs, scripts, or dev utilities. You choose what to share: GitHub URLs, IPFS files, or both.

Step 2 — Set Access & Pricing
Offer your components as free, paid, or subscription-accessible — all enforced trustlessly via smart contracts.

Step 3 — Start Earning On-Chain
Every purchase or subscription goes directly to your wallet. No delays. No lockups. No centralized cut.

Developer earnings: Up to 80% on direct purchases, plus passive income from subscriptions.
