- 🔄 **Testing Phase**: Ready for end-to-end encrypted upload testing

### 🚀 Next Priority: Pinata IPFS Integration for UI Data

**Problem to Solve**: 
- CID mappings are currently stored in localStorage, making them unavailable to other users
- Component metadata cannot be fetched because the original IPFS CIDs are lost after hashing
- This prevents the marketplace from displaying component descriptions, tags, and other metadata

**Solution Architecture**:
1. **Pinata Gateway Integration**:
   - Set up dedicated Pinata gateway for StarkFlux
   - Store component metadata with proper indexing
   - Implement CID mapping service

2. **Metadata Storage Pattern**:
   - Store original CID within the metadata JSON on IPFS
   - Create a mapping service that stores hashed_cid → original_cid relationships
   - Consider using Pinata's metadata API for searchable component data

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Create Pinata service module for UI
   - Implement metadata upload with CID preservation
   - Build CID resolution service
   - Update useComponentRegistry to fetch metadata properly
   - Add fallback mechanisms for missing metadata

4. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Component search using Pinata metadata
   - Tag-based filtering
   - Developer profiles stored on IPFS
   - Component screenshots and previews

  - **Contract Oracle**: `0x02a85bd616f912537c50a49a4076db02c00b29b2cdc8a197ce92ed1837fa875b` ❌ (Not deployed)
  - **Impact**: DevSubscription USD pricing functionality completely broken
  - **Workaround**: Developer Subscription features grayed out for MVP
  - **Solution**: Redeploy DevSubscription with correct Oracle address OR use STRK pricing only

### Current Issues
- ❗ `useComponentRegistry` uses mock data
- ❗ No subscription contract integration (blocked by Oracle issue above)
- ❗ Missing error recovery flows
- ❗ No caching strategy
- ❗ **Profile pictures stored as base64** - Need IPFS integration
- ❗ **Profile data in localStorage only** - Need IPFS + smart contract storage
- ❗ **ComponentRegistry set_subscription_managers issue** - Deployment script calls plural function but contract has singular `set_subscription_manager` (stub)
  - **Workaround**: Skip this configuration or only set MarketplaceSubscription address
  - **UI Impact**: Check DevSubscription and MarketplaceSubscription independently for access verification
- ✅ ~~Registration status detection~~ **FIXED**
- ✅ ~~RPC endpoint connectivity~~ **FIXED**
- ✅ ~~Contract response parsing~~ **FIXED**
- ✅ ~~Basic developer registration~~ **ENHANCED TO FULL PROFILE SYSTEM**
- ✅ ~~Profile save functionality~~ **IMPLEMENTED WITH VALIDATION**
