## Implementation Considerations

1. **User Experience Flow**:
   - Prioritize clear distinction between monetization models
   - Create guided flows for first-time users
   - Implement responsive design for all interfaces

2. **Smart Contract Integration**:
   - Ensure proper error handling with user-friendly messages
   - Implement transaction status tracking
   - Design for gas efficiency in batch operations

3. **Security and Testing**:
   - Implement comprehensive input validation
   - Develop detailed test cases for edge conditions
   - Consider formal verification for critical functions

4. **Future Expansion**:
   - Design UI components for extensibility
   - Plan for additional monetization models
